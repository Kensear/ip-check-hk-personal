This was made originally due to an **argument** with the original author about Netflix module.

As a Hong Kong university student, I **only** use nodes in **Hong Kong region** and hence only the checkers of that region were developed.

Switching among different **regions** very frequently may lead to critical login security alerts or even account ban.

**Note:**
Spotify Registration module may not give an accurate result under poor Internet conditions since it also detects proxy based on the **latency**.

## Running

Simply download and run the corresponding .py files in Python.

It's **not recommended** to run the same type of script (Check IP or Stream) many times under the **same IP address** in a day, or it may result in IP Ban.

Test IP Quality:
```
# Choose one based on your device/emulator.
python3 ./chkip.py
python ./chkip.py
```

Test Streaming/Local Websites:
```
# Choose one based on your device/emulator.
python3 ./chkstream.py
python ./chkstream.py
```

## New Features

This script adds the following features (improvements):

- Check if Sign-in Required for YouTube (i.e., "Sign in to confirm that you're not a bot")
- Check HK University Websites
- Check HK Bank Websites
- Check Mainland Websites (optional)

It's initially a Python version (with **urllib** module) so that it can be used on iOS (with iSH app), Windows, macOS, etc. apart from just Linux servers.

## My Previous Research

Apart from a programmerüßë‚Äçüíª and software developerüõ†Ô∏è, I am also a **researcher**üî¨ diving into the technical working principles behind.

I did a lot of personal research and experimentsüß™ about the Residential IPs and local ISPs around HK.

### Common HK ISPs

Whether from Residential IP providers or real local network (like WiFi in some places), I researchedüî¨ about some common ISPs and their AS (Autonomous System) numbers.

For example only. This is not an exhaustive list.<br>
H = Home; B = Business

|Name|Hostname Suffix|AS Number|Type|
|----|--|--|----|
|HKT|netvigator.com|AS4760|H|
|HKT Enterprise|imsbiz.com|AS4515|B|
|HK Cable TV|hkcable.com.hk|AS9908|H|
|SmarTone||AS17924|H|
|CMHK|hk.chinamobile.com|AS9231<br>AS137872|H|
|HKBN|ctinets.com|AS10103|H|
|HKBN Enterprise <sup>1</sup>||AS9381|B|
|HGC||AS9304|H/B|
|Hutchison (3/Three)||AS10118|H|
|JUCC (University Only) <sup>2</sup><br>||AS3662|B|

Notes:
1. Incorrectly labelled as **"Hosting"** (and even **VPN**) Type on IPinfo even if only used in normal WiFi, but I **failed the appeal (rejected)** (I contacted it before) due to its previous **mass port scanning** evidence (in its email reply).
2. Including downstream AS numbers for each university.

From my personal research and experiment, the WiFi of some universities may use HGC or HKBN Enterprise broadbands instead of JUCC (its own AS number).

### "Personality" of Residential IP Providers

Some Residential IP providers may have the following "personality":

- Ban **Bank** Websites/Apps (including HK and other Banks)
- Ban Mainland **ICP-Registered** Websites/Apps (regardless of whether the servers are in Mainland or not)

### HK Local Broadband Test Result

When testing Stream Restriction under HK local network (under any ISP mentioned above‚¨ÜÔ∏è), all testing had the **green "Y"** displayed, including those incorrectly labelled as Hosting by IPinfo.

## My Unique Personality

As a dedicated but technical student, my personality is very different from over 99% of other people. I always **uphold my unique ideas and opinions** in my personal and self-initiated projects.

I am currently experiencing mental stress with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Asperger Syndrome and **hardship** for listening to other's opinions and ideas.

However, you are still welcome to drop your ideasüì© to Issues and my contacts.
Do not try to oppose my unique idea and opinions when making suggestions.

Please visit my personal websiteüåé (https://ken.kenstudyjourney.cn) to learn more.

Thanks for your understanding.
