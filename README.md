**Note:**
Spotify Registration module may not give an accurate result on **iOS (iSH app)** and under poor Internet conditions, since it detects proxy based on the **latency**.

## Running

## New Features

This script adds the following features (improvements):

- Check if Sign-in Required for YouTube (i.e., "Sign in to confirm that you're not a bot")
- Check HK University Websites
- Check HK Bank Websites
- Check Mainland Websites (optional)

## My Unique Personality

As a dedicated but technical student, my personality is very different from over 99% of other people. I always **uphold my unique ideas and opinions** in my personal and self-initiated projects.

I am currently experiencing mental stress with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Asperger Syndrome and **hardship** for listening to other's opinions and ideas.

However, you are still welcome to drop your ideas to Issues and my contacts.

Thanks for your understanding.
